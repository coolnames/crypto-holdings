cryptocurrency holdings calc'd with coinmarketcap's api + php
```
by
  _  _   _  | ._   _. ._ _   _   _ 
 (_ (_) (_) | | | (_| | | | (/_ _> 
```

so, i wrote this simple page to make it easier to quickly check the value of my bags :sunglasses:

you can also edit both the Price and Holdings values to play around with scenarios of price changes and/or qty held changes.

#You will need an API key from coinmarketcap! https://coinmarketcap.com/api/

symbols and holdings are hardcoded, queried on page load.

depending on user settings in php, 1 API credit cost per page load minimum.  the included example uses 2 API credits per page load.

pricing and holding values are user editable after page load, to play with 'what if' scenarios on-the-fly.

this is only meant to be used as a casual tool to check on your holdings; accuracy not guaranteed. (didn't even try to iron out all the php float jenk)

hope people will use this as much as I do...or that this helps people learn how parse json data with php 

was this helpful? :call_me_hand:
