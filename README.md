symbols and holdings are hardcoded, queried on page load.

pricing and holding values are user editable after page load, to play with 'what if' scenarios on-the-fly.

this is only meant to be used as a casual tool to check on your holdings; accuracy not guaranteed. (didn't even try to iron out all the php float jenk)

#You will need an API key from coinmarketcap! https://coinmarketcap.com/api/

You can edit both the Price and Holdings values to play around with scenarios of price changes and/or qty held changes.
