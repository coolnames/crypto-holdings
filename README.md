crypto holdings calc'd with coinmarketcap's api + php

```

symbols and holdings are hardcoded, queried on page load.

pricing and holding values are user editable after page load, to play with 'what if' scenarios on-the-fly.

this is only meant to be used as a casual tool to check on your holdings; accuracy not guaranteed. (didn't even try to iron out all the php float jenk)
